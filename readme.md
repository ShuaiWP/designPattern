# Design Patterns and Code Examples

This repository contains descriptions and code examples for 23 common design patterns. These patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Introduce

This repository contains code examples and tests for each of the 23 design patterns. The code examples can be found in the `src/main` directory, organized by pattern. Each pattern has its own subdirectory containing the relevant code examples.

The tests for each pattern can be found in the `src/test` directory. These tests demonstrate how the code examples can be used and provide a way to verify their correctness.

We encourage you to explore the code examples and tests to gain a deeper understanding of each pattern and how it can be applied in practice.


## Creational Patterns
Creational patterns are used to create objects in a systematic way, abstracting the process of object creation and allowing for more flexibility in the type of objects that are created. Some common creational patterns include:

- Simple Factory：√
- Factory Method：√
- Abstract Factory：√
- Prototype
- Builder
- Singleton

## Structural Patterns
Structural patterns are used to define the relationships between objects, allowing for more complex structures to be created from simpler components. Some common structural patterns include:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are used to define the interactions between objects, allowing for more complex behavior to be achieved through the cooperation of multiple objects. Some common behavioral patterns include:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each pattern is described in detail in its own directory, along with code examples demonstrating its use. We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn more about design patterns and their practical applications.
